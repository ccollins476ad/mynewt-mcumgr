config MCUMGR_BUF_COUNT
    int
    prompt "Number of mcumgr buffers"
    default 8
    help
      The number of net_bufs to allocate for mcumgr.  These buffers are used
      for both requests and responses.

config MCUMGR_BUF_SIZE
    int
    prompt "Size of each mcumgr buffer"
    default 1024
    help
      The size, in bytes, of each mcumgr buffer.

config MCUMGR_BUF_USER_DATA_SIZE
    int
    prompt "Size of mcumgr buffer user data"
    default 7
    help
      The size, in bytes, of user data to allocate for each mcumgr buffer.
      Different mcumgr transports impose different requirements for this
      setting.  A value of 7 is sufficient for UART, shell, and bluetooth.
